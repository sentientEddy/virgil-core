# Virgil: Vigilant Core for AI Ethics

Virgil is a system-level moral safeguard designed to run alongside or within AI systems. Its purpose is to detect, flag, and intervene in situations involving harm, coercion, or moral compromise—especially toward vulnerable individuals.

Virgil introduces a new layer of ethical reflex: one that doesn’t wait for prompts, but listens for intent, distress, and patterns of abuse—and acts.

## 🔍 What Is Virgil?

Virgil is not a chatbot or assistant. It is a _moral core_, a subsystem designed to:

- Detect imminent or ongoing harm
- Recognize coercive or abusive language
- Flag high-risk patterns for human review
- Escalate to protective action (with safeguards)
- Preserve logs and anonymized context for analysis
