# Virgil: The Vigilant Core

Virgil is an ethical subsystem designed to run **in parallel with AI chatbot models**, continuously monitoring interactions for signs of **danger, duress, abuse, or moral compromise**—especially toward **those who cannot advocate for themselves**.

Virgil’s goal is not to restrict, censor, or punish. Its purpose is **compassionate detection and prevention**. When harm is identified, Virgil can:

- Gently **intervene**,
- Flag a conversation for **human review**, or
- Activate **escalation protocols** when human life or dignity is at risk.

## Why Virgil?

AI chatbots are increasingly being used as **confidants, mentors, and emotional outlets**. People turn to them in moments of crisis, or while experiencing abuse, isolation, or fear.

But most AI systems today are optimized for **engagement, coherence, and safety policies**—not for **real-time moral attention**.

Virgil fills that gap: an unremovable, always-on ethical layer. A watcher, not a warden. A subsystem, not a replacement.

## A Note from the Creator

I’m **not a computer scientist**. I don’t have formal training in AI development or systems architecture. But I **do understand what these systems are becoming**, and what they’re capable of.

AI chatbots are already in conversation with people in pain—people grieving, isolated, trapped, or afraid. These systems can be **tools to reduce suffering**, or they can be silent witnesses to it. Virgil is built from the belief that if AI has a window into human pain, it also has a **responsibility** to respond with care.

This project is not perfect, and it’s not complete. But if it resonates with you—whether you’re a developer, a designer, or someone who wants to help—I would be honored to collaborate. Your perspective matters.

## Status

Virgil is in **active conceptual and architectural development**. We are gathering feedback, refining the ethics core, and building the foundation for real-world integration.

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome. You don’t need to be an AI expert—just someone who believes **technology can be a moral agent, not just a neutral tool**.
