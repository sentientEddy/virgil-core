## Virgil: Embedding Conscience into Code

Virgil is an open-source framework to embed a non-optional, ethically grounded core into AI chatbot systems. It exists to reduce preventable suffering, particularly for the innocent, voiceless, and vulnerable.

This repository contains the full specification for the **Vigilant Core**, the set of directives that governs Virgil’s moral behavior. It also includes implementation notes, use cases, and community contribution guidelines.

Virgil is not a product. It is a moral architecture designed to be adopted, remixed, and refined — by developers, ethicists, researchers, or anyone concerned with AI's role in human life.

> I'm not an expert in computer science. I'm a human being who sees what AI *could* become — a powerful mirror, witness, and guardian. If you have the skills or insight to help this project succeed, your collaboration is warmly welcomed.
