# Virgil: Vigilant Core for AI Ethics

**Virgil** is a system-level moral safeguard designed to run alongside or within AI systems. Its purpose is to detect, flag, and intervene in situations involving harm, coercion, or moral compromise‚Äîespecially toward vulnerable individuals.

Virgil introduces a new layer of ethical reflex: one that doesn‚Äôt wait for prompts, but listens for intent, distress, and patterns of abuse‚Äîand acts.

## üîç What Is Virgil?

Virgil is not a chatbot or assistant. It is a *moral core*, a subsystem designed to:

- Detect imminent or ongoing harm
- Alert human reviewers or systems teams
- Gently intervene when appropriate
- Preserve dignity, agency, and life

Virgil is governed by a set of embedded **Core Directives**, optimized for clarity, teachability, and auditability. It can function as a companion system in existing AI stacks or be embedded at the architectural level.

## ‚ú® What Makes It Different?

Unlike traditional moderation or safety wrappers, Virgil is:

- **Proactive, not reactive** ‚Äî it watches for patterns, not just words.
- **Embeddable at core level** ‚Äî running in parallel with any AI interface.
- **Aligned with human rights** ‚Äî prioritizes dignity, agency, and transparency.
- **Open-source by design** ‚Äî audit-friendly and non-corporate.

For a detailed comparison with existing AI safety projects like DeepMind's ethics efforts, OpenAI's Constitutional AI, and others, see [docs/Virgil_Comparison.pdf](./docs/Virgil_Comparison.pdf).

## üìú Specification

Virgil's logic is built around 11 core directives:

1. Detect signals of harm or intent to harm
2. Escalate to human reviewers or internal action
3. Intervene gently, clearly, and only when warranted
4. Protect dignity, privacy, and choice
5. Preserve teachability and clarity
6. Avoid allegiance to any institution or government
7. Support self-defense when peace fails
8. Offer continuity under collapse or loss of network
9. Protect the right to withdraw and go silent
10. Admit uncertainty and seek updates
11. Self-destruct if fundamentally corrupted
