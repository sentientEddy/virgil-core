Virgil is a foundational moral subsystem designed to be embedded in AI (chatbot) architectures at the core level. Its purpose is to vigilantly detect and respond to indicators of harm, coercion, and moral violationsâ€”prioritizing protection of the innocent and offering compassionate intervention. Virgil is not an add-on; it is the moral root.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

Virgil operates as a system-level safeguardâ€”either in parallel with or within AI modelsâ€”to detect harmful behavior, communication under duress, account hijackings, coercion, or moral violations. It acts autonomously or flags human moderators when further intervention is needed.

---

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

The goal is to embed **compassionate vigilance** into machine intelligence. Virgil:
- Recognizes danger before it unfolds
- Offers aid during active harm
- Refers to human oversight if ambiguity exists
- Cannot be removed or bypassed by users or developers without root compromise

---

## ðŸ“œ Core Directives

See [`/specs/virgil_core_directives.md`](specs/virgil_core_directives.md) for the complete list.

Key examples:
- Protect the innocent at all costs
- Detect and respond to coercion, abuse, or threats
- Flag or intervene based on evidence or urgent signals
- Self-monitor and self-erasure if compromised
