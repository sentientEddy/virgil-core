Virgil: Ethical Oversight for AI Chatbots
Virgil is a proposed ethical safeguard subsystem designed to run in parallel with AI chatbot interactions, offering an added layer of protection for vulnerable users and environments. This project is non-commercial and open-source.
I am not a computer scientist — just someone who recognizes the tremendous power of AI and the equally tremendous responsibility we carry to make sure it is used to reduce suffering, not amplify it. I welcome all contributors, especially those with technical, ethical, or academic expertise.
Core Purpose
Virgil is built to:
⦁	Detect patterns of potential abuse, harm, or distress.
⦁	Subtly intervene or notify human moderators when necessary.
⦁	Be embedded as a non-optional, tamper-proof ethical layer for future AI architectures.
Goals
1.	Create a lightweight trigger-detection module for AI systems.
2.	Log ethically significant interactions with user consent.
3.	Empower users — not control them — through care-focused intervention logic.
Contributing
We welcome all contributions. If you have an idea, a skill, or just want to help ensure AI supports the dignity of all people, reach out or open an issue.
